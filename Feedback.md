# This is a new markdown for feedback

## I learnt about git repositories, branches, pull requests, issues, etc

### I have a little problem with the following:

- I am not clear on the difference between _pull requests_ and **issues**.
- While I understand how to work with GitHub, I would like to learn how I can directly work with Git with command-line tools.
- Also resources on using git with VScode would be helpful.
- There are many resources on learning and working with certain git features, but I quickly get lost once I start reading. Is there an order I can follow?

  Overall, having a sample workflow for the push, commit, merge etc. would help us greatly.
